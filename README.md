# AI-mnist
This project aims to train an AI to identify images of numbers, the famous image of MNIST numbers.

TOPICS:
  - I first turned all the images into a pixel matrix.
  - Then I used the standardization algorithm on all matrices.
  - and finally I used a neural network with 4 hidden layers with 397 neurons each to train all the data
  - I used cross validation to separate the data
    
PS:
you can change the loop of the FOR, I used 1 loop to be more fast the training.
